# 1Anime Organization

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for [1Anime](https://1anime.co)! We are dedicated to providing a platform for anime enthusiasts to explore and share various anime-related projects.

## About Us

1Anime is a community-driven organization that focuses on creating and maintaining high-quality anime content. Currently, we have released V1 of our site, which is distinct from our landing page. Our mission is to enhance the anime experience for fans around the world through innovative tools and resources.

## Projects

- **V1 of the Site**: Our complete site for watching anime includes AniList tracking, customizable themes, and an ad-free experience, ensuring that fans can enjoy their favorite shows without interruptions.
- **Landing Page**: A separate, user-friendly landing page designed to welcome visitors and provide information about our offerings.
- **Private Projects**: We are working on additional features and tools that will be shared in the future, but some projects remain private to protect our work from being copied.
